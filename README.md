### To Do:
- Editing colors for lights
- Maybe something else that I don't already have in HA.

### Devices supported
- Mi Band 7 (You need modified Zepp app (see preparations))
- Amazfit Band 7
- All other Zepp OS (square) devices, but there is no proper UI for them

### Preparations
#### Mi Band 7
- [Modified Zepp App](https://4pda.to/forum/index.php?showtopic=797981&st=15700#entry122653549) (registration required)
- You need to connect Mi Band 7 to Modified Zepp App the same way you would with Zepp Life (google auth is not  supported)
- You need to enable [Developer Mode](https://docs.zepp.com/docs/1.0/guides/tools/zepp-app/) in app
- Install app with QR-code (soon) or build yourself
- Open the application settings and specify the addresses of Home Assistant, Long-lived access token and select the sensors you want to display on Zepp OS device
#### Home Assistant
- Long-lived access token (you can generate it on your-ha-instance.local/profile page)
- "If you are not using the [`frontend`](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/frontend/) in your setup then you need to add the [`api` integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/api/) to your `configuration.yaml` file."
